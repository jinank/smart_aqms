- **Team Names**: Justin, Sravani, Jinank
- **Background**: City skyline with air quality overlay

### Script:
> "Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're presenting our Smart City Air Quality Monitoring System - a real-time environmental intelligence platform built on Azure PostgreSQL. I'm [Name], and I'm joined by my teammates [Names]. Our system addresses the critical challenge of urban air quality management through advanced data analytics and predictive modeling."

**Talking Points:**

- Our solution: Real-time monitoring + predictive analytics
- Technology: Azure cloud + PostgreSQL relational database

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 2: Problem Statement (30 seconds)

### Visual Elements:
- **Statistics**: 
  - "91% of world population lives in areas with poor air quality" - WHO
  - "7 million premature deaths annually due to air pollution"
- **Images**: Polluted cities, health impacts
- **Challenge Icons**: Real-time monitoring, data management, prediction

### Script:
> "Air pollution is one of the most pressing urban challenges today. According to the WHO, 91% of the world's population lives in areas where air quality exceeds safe limits. Traditional monitoring systems are limited - they're expensive, provide delayed data, and lack predictive capabilities. Cities need a scalable, real-time solution that can predict air quality trends and trigger alerts before conditions become hazardous."

**Talking Points:**
- Current systems are reactive, not proactive
- Need for real-time data collection and analysis
- Importance of predictive capabilities for public health

## 🎬 SLIDE 3: Solution Architecture (45 seconds)

### Visual Elements:
- **Architecture Diagram** showing:
  ```
  [Sensors] → [Data Ingestion] → [Azure PostgreSQL] → [Analytics & ML] → [Streamlit Dashboard]
  ```
- **Technology Stack Icons**: PostgreSQL, Python, Streamlit, Azure
- **Data Flow Animation**: Sensors → Database → Visualization

### Script:
> "Our solution leverages a robust three-tier architecture. At the base, we have distributed sensor stations across five city zones - Downtown, Uptown, Industrial, Harbor, and Park areas. These sensors continuously collect air quality metrics including PM2.5, CO2, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

> The data flows into our Azure PostgreSQL database, which we've designed with a sophisticated relational schema. This isn't just a data dump - we've implemented a normalized database structure with six interrelated tables that maintain data integrity and enable complex analytical queries.

> Finally, our Streamlit dashboard provides real-time visualization and insights, with automatic refresh capabilities and interactive maps. The entire pipeline processes data in near real-time, with our system capable of handling over 1,200 readings per minute."

**Talking Points:**
- Scalable sensor network across city zones
- Cloud-based data storage on Azure
- Real-time processing and visualization
- Highlight the 1,200 readings/minute capability

           ↓
    SYSTEM_METRICS
  ```
- **Table Details** with key columns highlighted
- **Relationship Lines** showing foreign keys

### Script:
> "Let me walk you through our relational database schema - this is the core deliverable of our project. We've designed a comprehensive six-table structure deployed on Azure PostgreSQL.

> **First, the STATIONS table** - our master table containing metadata for each monitoring station: location coordinates, zone information, installation dates, and operational status. Each station has a unique identifier and tracks maintenance schedules.

> **Second, the SENSORS table** - because each station can have multiple sensors. This table maintains sensor-specific information including type, model, calibration dates, and accuracy specifications. The foreign key relationship ensures referential integrity with the stations table.

> **Third, AIR_QUALITY_READINGS** - our largest table with time-series data. Each reading is linked to both a station and a specific sensor, capturing PM2.5, CO2, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and data quality scores. We've implemented check constraints to ensure data validity - for example, humidity must be between 0 and 100 percent.

> **Fourth, the ALERTS table** - automatically generated when readings exceed safety thresholds. Each alert is linked to a specific reading and station, includes severity levels from Low to Critical, and tracks acknowledgment and resolution status.

> **Fifth, PREDICTIONS table** - stores our machine learning model outputs. Each prediction is uniquely tied to a reading, includes the predicted AQI category, confidence scores, and probability distributions across different air quality levels.

> **Finally, SYSTEM_METRICS** - tracks our system's performance including data ingestion rates, processing latency, and system health indicators.

> All tables are interconnected through foreign key relationships, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex joins for analytics."

**Talking Points:**
- Emphasize the **relational nature** - not just flat tables
- Highlight **referential integrity** through foreign keys
- Mention **data validation** through constraints
- Note the **scalability** - currently 6,500+ readings
- Point out **indexes** for query performance

  2. PM2.5 trend chart
  3. Alerts table
  4. Interactive map
  5. Station statistics

### Script:
> "Now let me show you our live dashboard in action. [Switch to browser at localhost:8502]

> At the top, we have our key performance indicators - average PM2.5 levels, CO2 concentrations, maximum readings, total records processed, and active alerts. Notice the color-coded indicators - green for good, yellow for moderate, and red for concerning levels.

> This line chart shows PM2.5 trends across our five city zones over the last 3 hours. You can see the Industrial zone consistently shows higher pollution levels, while the Park area maintains healthier air quality. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds, giving us true real-time monitoring.

## 🎬 SLIDE 12: Q&A (Backup Slides)

### Prepare answers for common questions:

**Q: How does your system handle data privacy?**
> A: Our system collects environmental data only - no personal information. All data is aggregated at the station level. For future citizen reporting features, we'll implement anonymization and comply with GDPR/privacy regulations.

**Q: What's the cost of deployment?**
> A: Azure PostgreSQL costs vary by tier. For a city of 500K people with 20 stations, estimated monthly cost is $200-500 for database hosting plus sensor hardware costs (~$500 per station). This is significantly cheaper than traditional monitoring systems.

**Q: How accurate are your predictions?**
> A: Our current model achieves 85-90% accuracy for AQI category prediction. Accuracy improves with more training data. We're implementing continuous learning to refine predictions over time.

**Q: Can this scale to larger cities?**
> A: Absolutely. Our architecture is designed for horizontal scaling. Azure PostgreSQL can handle millions of readings. We've tested throughput up to 1,200 readings/minute, sufficient for 100+ stations.

**Q: What about sensor maintenance?**
> A: Our sensors table tracks calibration dates and maintenance schedules. The system can flag sensors needing attention based on data quality scores and calibration intervals.

**Q: How do you ensure data quality?**
> A: Multiple layers: sensor-level validation, database constraints (check constraints for valid ranges), data quality scoring algorithm, and anomaly detection through ML models.
