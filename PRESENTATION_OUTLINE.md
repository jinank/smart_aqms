## Demo Script for Video Recording

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
"Welcome to our Azure PostgreSQL Streaming Analytics Pipeline demonstration. Today I'll show you our Smart City Air Quality Monitoring System that processes hundreds of records per minute in real-time."

### Database Architecture (0:30 - 1:15)
"Let me start by showing you our database schema. We have 5 interrelated tables deployed on Azure PostgreSQL, with time-partitioned main tables for optimal performance. Here you can see our monitoring stations across different city zones..."

### Data Streaming Demo (1:15 - 2:15)
"Now let's see the data streaming in action. I'm starting our data generator that will create 300 records per minute with realistic air quality patterns. Watch as the data flows into our Azure PostgreSQL database..."

### Anomaly Detection Demo (2:15 - 3:15)
"Our outlier detection system runs every 30 seconds, using both Isolation Forest and statistical methods. Here you can see it detecting anomalies and generating alerts with different severity levels..."

### ML Pipeline Demo (3:15 - 4:15)
"The machine learning component continuously updates its AQI prediction model using online learning. Watch as it processes new data and improves its predictions in real-time..."

### Dashboard Demo (4:15 - 5:15)
"Our real-time dashboard updates every 10 seconds, showing comprehensive air quality metrics, geospatial visualizations, and alert management. You can see the live updates happening right now..."

### Conclusion (5:15 - 5:30)
"This completes our streaming analytics pipeline demonstration. We've successfully built a production-ready system that meets all project requirements and can scale to real-world smart city deployments."
